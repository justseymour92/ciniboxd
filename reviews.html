        <h1>review of interstellar</h1>

        <p>
            saw this in IMAX and i swear my soul left my body somewhere around saturn and has yet to return. hans zimmer
            hit one note on that organ and my ribcage became a subwoofer. i wasn't watching a movie i was being baptized
            by sound waves. everytime mcConaughey cried, the scren was so big i felt like i was physically trapped
            inside his tear duct. the scene where he watches those video messages? IMAX made me feel like i was the
            video message. the cornfields looked so crisp on that screen i was ready to stand up and butter them. the
            wormhole sequence? pretty sure i got a mild concussion from pure visuals. the black hole scene? time slowed
            down in real life i left the cinema three hours later and my family was 80 years older. TARS spinning around
            in IMAX deserves his own oscar. nolan should've just released that scene on a loop and i'd still clap
            10/10,would let IMAX rearrange my organs again.
