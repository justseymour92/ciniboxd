        movies you watched this year. Lists makes it easy to share your taste with others, and they
        also help you keep track of different moods or genres. Some people make lists for horror
        marathons, top ten comedies, or underrated hidden gems thst deserve more attention.

        show off your personality and your love for cinema.</p>
